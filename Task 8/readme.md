# Cyber Security Internship: Task 8 - VPN Analysis

## üéØ Objective
The primary goal of this task was to understand the role of **Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)** in protecting user **privacy** and ensuring **secure communication**. This involved hands-on setup, verification, and research.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
* **VPN Client:** ProtonVPN Free
* **IP Verification:** `whatismyipaddress.com`

---

## üìù Steps Taken

I followed the provided guide to complete the task:

1.  **Selection and Setup:** I chose a reputable free VPN service and signed up. I then downloaded and installed the VPN client.
2.  **Connection:** I connected to a VPN server located in Netherlands.
3.  **IP Verification:** Before connecting, I noted my public IP. After connecting, I verified that my IP address had changed using `whatismyipaddress.com`.
4.  **Encryption Confirmation:** I browsed a website to confirm that traffic was being tunneled and was encrypted.
5.  **Performance Comparison:** I disconnected the VPN and compared the browsing speed and the public IP address against the connected state.
6.  **Research:** I conducted research on various VPN encryption and privacy features.

## üî¨ Research Summary: VPN Benefits and Limitations

### VPN Benefits
* **Enhanced Privacy:** VPNs protect privacy by masking the user's IP address and routing traffic through an encrypted tunnel.
* **Secure Communication:** They secure data, especially on untrusted networks, by using **encryption**.
* **Network Security:** They utilize various tunneling protocols to establish a secure connection.

### VPN Limitations
* **Speed Impact:** A VPN can affect network speed, often leading to slower browsing due to the overhead of encryption and server distance.
* **Not Total Anonymity:** A VPN cannot guarantee complete anonymity, as other tracking methods may still apply.
* **Trust in Provider:** The user must trust the VPN provider's no-logging policy, as all traffic passes through their servers.
