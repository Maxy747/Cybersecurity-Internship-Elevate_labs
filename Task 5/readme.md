# Cyber Security Internship - Task 5: Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark

## Overview

This repository contains the deliverables for **Task 5: Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark** as part of the Elevate Labs Cyber Security Internship.

The objective of this task was to **capture live network packets and identify basic protocols and traffic types** using the free network protocol analyzer, **Wireshark**.

---

## Deliverables

1.  **Packet Capture File:** `scanshark.pcap`
2.  **Summary Report:** This `README.md` serves as the short report of protocols identified.

*Note: The required deliverables are a **packet capture (.pcap) file and a short report of protocols identified**.*

---

## Process and Steps Followed

I followed the provided mini-guide to complete the task:

1.  **Installed Wireshark**.
2.  **Started a capture** on my active network interface.
3.  **Generated traffic** by browsing a website and running a few `ping` commands to a remote server.
4.  **Stopped the capture** after approximately one minute.
5.  **Filtered the captured packets** by protocol (e.g., UDP, DNS, TCP).
6.  **Identified at least 3 different protocols** within the capture.
7.  **Exported the capture** as the `.pcap` file.
8.  **Summarized the findings** in the next section.

## Findings: Protocol Analysis

I successfully identified the following protocols in the captured traffic:

| Protocol | Description | Example Filters Used | Packet Count in Capture |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **DNS** | **Domain Name System**. Used to resolve human-readable domain names into IP addresses. Captured when initiating network connections. | `dns` or `udp.port == 53` | 62 |
| **TCP** | **Transmission Control Protocol**. A connection-oriented protocol ensuring reliable, ordered data delivery. Seen in three-way handshakes (`SYN`, `SYN-ACK`, `ACK`). | `tcp` or `tcp.flags.syn == 1` | 1580 |
| **ICMP** | **Internet Control Message Protocol**. Used for diagnostic and error reporting (e.g., generated by the `ping` command). | `icmp` | 8 |
| **HTTP** | **HyperText Transfer Protocol**. The core protocol for communication over the World Wide Web. | `http` | 45 |
| **ARP** | **Address Resolution Protocol**. Used to map an IP address to a physical (MAC) address on a local network. | `arp` | 12 |

***Note:** The counts above reflect the number of packets for each protocol found in the provided `scanshark.pcap` file.*
